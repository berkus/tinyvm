Specify a label named "start," and it will become the entrypoint for the program.

start:	mov [1], 1000000000
	xor [10], [10]
	
	mov [0], 3
loop0:	add [10], [0]
	add [0], 3
	cmp [0], [1]
	jl loop0

Unrecognized shit isn't parsed, as long as it's not 
on the same line as a valid instruction.

	mov [0], 5
loop1:	add [10], [0]
	add [0], 15
	cmp [0], [1]
	jl loop1

Comments can be entered on _any_ line that doesn't contain
a valid opcode. TVM does not give a fuck.

	mov [0], 10
loop2:	add [10], [0]
	add [0], 15
	cmp [0], [1]
	jl loop2
	mov [0], [10]
